      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My journey in computer science is fueled by curiosity and a desire to create tangible impact. I bring a blend
        of analytical rigor honed through my background in math and research and a creative drive to innovate and solve
        real problems.
        As a San Francisco native, I thrive in dynamic, fast-paced environments. My time in the Midwest has cultivated a
        midwestern affability and collaborative spirit that I bring to every connection. I'm always looking to blend
        diverse perspectives and skills to tackle new challenges. Let's build something great together!

      <h1>Research</h1>
      <h3>Large-Scale Systems Group: Cerebras Project</h3>
      <p>I collaborated with Cerebras Systems and Argonne National Labrotory to
        explore new applications for the CS-1, wafer-scale engine. This effort
        included both benchmarking and the design of new applications software.
        To conclude this research project, and my time as an undergraduate at
        UChicago, I wrote an honors thesis titled, <i>A Particle In Cell
          Implementation on the CS-2</i>.

      <h3>UChicago Math REU</h3>
      <p>I spent Summer of 2019 attending lectures and problem solving sessions
        to gain exposure to fields of math not typically covered in the
        undergraduate curriculum. I chose to focus on Topology, and worked
        with a grad-student mentor to study <i>Topology from a Differential
          Viewpoint</i> by John W. Milnor. I wrote a formal expository math paper
        on the Poincaré-Hopf Theorem and its applications to n-dimensional
        spheres </p>

      <h3>This Website!</h3>
      <p>I have always been curious about web design and been amazed at the

        I would love any feedback on design ideas or code implementation.
        Let me know what you think!</p>
