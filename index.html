        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I am a software engineer who strives to innovate and solving
          problems that impact real people. In June 2021, I graduated UChicago
          with degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics. I currently work as
          a Back End Developer at IBM.

        <h3>Large-Scale Systems Group: Cerebras Project</h3>
        <p>I am working with Cerebras Systems and Argonne National Labrotory to
          explore new applications for the CS-1, wafer-scale engine. This effort
          includes both benchmarking and the design of new applications software.
          To conclude this research project, and my time as an undergraduate at
          UChicago, I wrote an honors thesis titled, <i>A Particle In Cell
          Implementation on the CS-2</i>.

        <h3>UChicago Math REU</h3>
        <p>I spent Summer of 2019 attending lectures and problem solving sessions
          to gain exposure to fields of math not typically covered in the
          undergraduate curriculum. I chose to focus on Topology, and worked
          with a grad-student mentor to study <i>Topology from a Differential
          Viewpoint</i> by John W. Milnor. I wrote a formal expository math paper
          on the Poincaré-Hopf Theorem and it’s applications to n-dimensional
          spheres </p>
